<h3>Three points of interest:</h3>

“Even thinking of movement triggers movement” 
<p>This point was extremely interesting to me because of the unusual thought it provokes. I tried to do this myself and I did not notice any movement in my hand beside the usual shaking that occurs. Is thinking that my hand shakes caused because of my mind or does it occur because of some outside variable.</p> 

“He would never work directly on a painful area” 
<p>I found this extremely interesting because of how the mind perceives and monitors itself. The area in which his pupil noticed pain frequently generated more pain when physically controlled. The body seems to be in touch with itself more than I previously thought. These practices could be transferred into physical therapy to produce results for those struggling with movement issues.</p>

“No part of the body can be moved without the others being affected”
<p>This idea interested me greatly. I tried to move my finger and sense movements in the other parts of my body even if it is extremely unnoticeable. I could detect movement throughout my forearms and into my shoulder. This was interesting but not outside of my knowledge. It was only when I noticed movement in my chest that I became self aware.</p>

<h3>My experience:</h3>

	<p>Throughout the Awareness Through Movement lesson I noticed many unique occurrences. Before the lesson even started I could notice that my ankles were more flexible on the left side of my body, I did not know currently that this was a usual experience. As the exercise began I noticed many things happening through my body. I tended to hold my arms against my body, it was only once my arms were told to be held at my sides that I noticed this. It felt unusual to keep my arms anywhere beside the default areas in which I normally hold them. As the Movements started becoming more advanced I noticed many different changes on both sides on my body as my right arm moved away from my chest. Throughout my body many things occurred that I had not previously noticed such as the way my body relaxes more to the right as well as having the tendency to lean into the direction of the arm. My body also had noticeable muscle movements throughout it, I could even feel movement in my jaw. As the exercise continued my body became more relaxed and functional on the left side without even practicing the movement on that side. I also noted that my arms always wanted to flip over from facing the ground and return to being clenched towards my body. I had to fight these urges to complete the desired movements. Once the lesson was concluded my body felt more relaxed and my range of moment was increased, I feel as if doing these abnormal movements everyday would greatly improve everyday life.</p>
