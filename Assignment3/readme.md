<p>My movements demonstrate a character who has discovered a human shelf for the first time. Originally this Humanoid creature does not notice this object and the capture begins with them doing some pushups as well as some stretching near the shelf. Once the exercise is completed the character goes on a light jog around their small alien 3D world in which they live. Here they proceed to bump into the shelf which causes the creature alarm. They begin to stand on and interact with the object trying to figure out what it could offer to them. As they stand on it they almost lose their balance when on top of it. They jump with joy due to the excitement received from interacting with such a strange object. </p>
